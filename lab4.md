# Step 4
![Image](step 4, up 1 then enter.png)<br>
Keys pressed:`<up><enter>`<br> The `ssh rgabel@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in my history so I used the up arrow to get it. This command connected me to the remote system to run my commands on.
# Step 5
![Image](step 5, up 13 then enter.png)<br>
Keys pressed:`<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>` The `git clone git@github.com:SamuraiChamp/lab7.git` command was 13 up in my history so I used the up arrow to get it. This command cloned the repository that I forked.
# Step 6
![Image](step 6, up 13 then enter then up 13 then enter then up 13 then enter.png)<br>
Keys pressed:`<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>` The `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` was 13 up in my history so I used the up arrow to get that. Then the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command was 13 up in my history so I did another 13 up to get that. These commands run the junit tests to test this code.
# Step 7

Keys pressed:`<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, `44<shift>gwhi<backspace>2<esc><shift>;wq<enter>` The `vim ListExamples.java` command was 13 up in my history so I accessed it with up. Once in vim, `44<shift>g` jumps to the first character on line 44, `wh` moves the cursor one word ahead and then one space to the left, `i<backspace>2<esc>` enters insert mode then deletes the 1 in `index1` then types a 2 then exits insert mode, `<shift>;wq<enter>` types `:wq` which is used to exit vim and save changes to the file. These commands open vim to edit the code, edit the code with the necessary change, then close and save the changes from vim.
# Step 8
![Image](step 8, up 3 then enter then up 3 then enter.png)<br>
Keys pressed:`<up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><enter>` The `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` was 3 up in my history so I used the up arrow to get that. Then the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` command was 3 up in my history so I did another 3 up to get that. These commands rerun the junit tests.
# Step 9

Keys pressed:`<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>` The `git add -A .` command was 13 up in my history so I used up to get that then both the `git commit -m "lab7"` command and the `git push` command were 13 up when I went to run them so I did the same steps. These commands add the changes to my github repo.
